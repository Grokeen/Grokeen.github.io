# Project
- üèÄ English Conversation Service Using Chat GPT(2023.05.27 ~ 2023.06.03)
  - Main content :

    These days, prices are so expensive, such as English academies and language training, so I worked on a toy project to study English conversation alone. When I entered my English conversation word, that is, the value in the prompt, I proceeded by receiving the Chat GPT's answer value. Version 4.0 can set and use the default learning value in custom instruction, but Chat GPT, which is imported into API, supports version 3.5, so as a result, it had to be set again every time.

  - Task : **Leveraging the Open AI API**


- üèÄ Online Portfolio Website (2023 - ÌòÑÏû¨)
  - Main content :
    
    This is an online portfolio website created to organize personal projects using Github.
  
  - [Î∞©Î¨∏ÌïòÍ∏∞](https://grokeen.github.io)

  ![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Grokeen&show_icons=true&theme=radical)<!-- ÍπÉÌóàÎ∏å ÏÉÅÌÉú ÌëúÏãú -->

  - Task : **Git, Markdown, Liquid, YAML Front Matter**


- üèÄ After the aptitude evaluation using the Spring Framework, the HR classification website suitable for the work competency(2021.11.18 ~ 2021.12.10)
  - Tech University of Korea
  - Main content :
    
    Among new employees, 59.2% (multiple responses) of "job that does not fit with aptitude" were the top reasons for leaving the company, followed by "organizational maladjustment such as relationship with person" (26.4%) and "discontent with work in charge (23.2%)", and a personnel classification website using Spring was developed to prevent it in advance. I was in charge of the UI in the project, helped with the blockage in each function, and the sub-role helped me gain an understanding of the overall spring logic. In the case of DB design, since the project was carried out first without planning because time was short, I found defects in DB design after it was developed, and I have experience of refactoring the project in a short period of time.
    
  - Task : **MVC Pattern View, DB Design, Overall Supporters of the Project**


- üèÄ Beginner Developer Resume/Cursary Help Site using Django(2021.10.24 ~ 2021.11.17)
  - KIC campus academy
  - Main content :
    
    Nowadays, many people are preparing for employment as developers, there is a lack of information on resumes and cover letters. Use the frequency results of successful cover letters for statistical analysis through text mining. By comparing DJango and Spring, we identified the flow of web development in Python and proceeded with the development.
    
  - Task : **Data collection via web crawling, Django, front end**


- üèÄ Restaurant reservation website using Spring framework(2021.08.30 ~ 2021.09.23)
  - KIC campus academy
  - Main content : 
    
    When the fourth stage of distancing was implemented due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19, a kind of reservation service was implemented using Spring, which allows customers to stand in line without waiting in line with a simple user's manipulation. To increase the completeness of the reservation function, Google Map API was used to enable consumers to more intuitively check the location of the restaurant, and Ajax was developed to enable real-time asynchronous transfer of reservation messages to restaurant owners when making a reservation.
    
  - Task : **Front-end, Google Map API to derive restaurant information, implement reservation functions, and connect functions**


- üèÄ Raspberry Pie Corrects Exercise Posture Smart Mirror(2020.03 ~ 2020.12)
  - Tech University of Korea
  - Main content : 
    
    Just as lifestyle habits have changed due to COVID-19, we focused on the current era in which the perception of exercise is also changing differently. As the distancing level 2.5 order was issued, the ban on access to the gym was dropped. As a result, as home training became popular, we created a smart mirror that statistically analyzes posture through CNN and provides correction information during exercise using Rajverapi.
    
  - Task : **Raspberry Pi Smart Mirror Code Analysis and Modification, UI Design**
