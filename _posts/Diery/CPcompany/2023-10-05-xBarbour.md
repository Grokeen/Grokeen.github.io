금일 오후 5시 4분에 구독해뒀던 CP컴퍼니에서 바버와 콜라보 한다는 매일이 왔다.

Re-Loved is Barbour’s initiative that encourages its customers to return their Barbour waxed jackets when they are no longer of service to them. The jackets handed in are then cleaned, sanitized and mended to be restored or upcycled, giving them a new lease of life, and sold to be re-loved in a new home.

C.P. Company joins the Re-Loved initiative, designing a detachable Explorer hood for each unique Re-Loved jacket, representing the seamless fusion of the two brand’s most recognisable signatures.

From October 9th until October 12th, people worldwide can enter the raffle for a chance to buy one of these exclusive jackets. The proceeds from the sale will be donated to the World Land’s Trust.
