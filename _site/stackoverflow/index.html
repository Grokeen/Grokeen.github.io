<p>According to the Homebrew site, to install it, I need to type:</p>

<p>brew install wget
I get an error message:</p>

<p>-bash: brew: command not found
Found this answer. The problem, however, is I don’t see brew in /usr/local/bin.</p>

<p>I added the below line to my .bashrc file</p>

<p>export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
Still getting the command not found error.</p>

<p>How do I install Homebrew on macOS?</p>

<p>/bin/bash -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)”</p>
